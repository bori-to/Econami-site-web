## Where should I go from here ?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, take the first step by creating an issue in the GitHub repository. This is the first step to contributing to Our WEBSITE !

## Fork and create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then create the repository and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where number 5 is the ticket you are working on):

```bash
git checkout -b feature/55-add-name-update
```

## Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you are ready to make your changes! Do not hesitate to ask for help, everyone is a beginner at the beginning.

## Write a good commit message

Write a good commit message.

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "[UPDATE] features update #5"
```

## Submit a pull request

Push your branch to your fork on GitHub, then hit the New pull request button, and you're good to go !

It's generally a good idea to have the content of a PR exactly cover a specific issue and to have a reference to that issue in your pull request description.


# Thanks again for your contribution !
